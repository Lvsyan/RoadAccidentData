# Description

I've been watching videos of projects to learn how to make a dashboard in Excel and also look to Cleaning Data, Data Processing and Data Analysis/Visualization.

I really thanks this type of videos being made to let beginner people learn the basics + some tools to do it faster.

## Filters

We can show them below in the corner where we can see:

- Dates from **2021, 2022 and 2023**

- If they were **Rural** or **Urban**

## Dashboard

Fatal Casualties -> we can see that we only have 1,7% of fatal casualties, even being really small, it's important to understand that we have to take more care in the road

Serios Casualties -> it's 59.312 serious casualties, even tho are not fatal but is important to see how much people could pass away

Slight Casualties -> we can observer that the most part of the total of casualties are slight, even tho is a bad new, atleast are not the worse

Casualties by Car -> the most part are from cards as we can see, so we should beware of it

Total Casualties Vehicle Type -> 

CY Casualties vs Py Casualties Monthly Trend -> watching this graphic we can realise that were growing every month from 2021 till the end of 2022

Casualties by Road Type -> the most casualties where with single carriageway being 309.698

Casualties by Road Surface -> we can see the surface where being dry is where there are having the most accident, we can notice that when we are calm the worst happens because we are not concentrated

Casualties by Location/Area -> normally the casualties happens in urban but with not much different

Casualties by Light Condition -> looks like knowing that when we're in daylight there is no focus because we think nothing wont happens

### Extra Information

What is in the left we can see:

- Summary -> you can join the excel tab below
- Dashboard -> where we can see all the information
- Send mail -> send a mail to me
- Dataset -> wikipedia where we can see all the information

## Conclusion

Watching this dashboard and information we can realice that even if there is a small part of the whole country Great Britain, is an important data where the people should see and take care on the street and roads, being that an important data on motorcycle, cars and vans are the ones that have more accidents.

## Programs

- Excel 2016

## Feedback
